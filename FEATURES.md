## Notes for Demo

1. **Calendar View:** During demo, can explain that calendar view will be implemented in Deliverable 2 when we have real-time data from backend

2. **Static Data:** All data is hard-coded as per Deliverable 1 requirements - this is acceptable

3. **Buttons Without Function:** Many buttons show UI but won't perform actions until Deliverable 2. This is expected for frontend-only submission

4. **Vibrant Design:** Color scheme (pink, teal, yellow gradients) chosen to make it look modern and fun while keeping it student-made
